# disdrometer-tools

A library of tools written predominantly in R (potentially soon with a python wrapper) that facilitates analysis of disdrometer data and integration with pre-existing rain gages.

These tools are being developed by the Hydrometeorology Group in the Civil Environmental Engineering Department at Princeton University (<http://hydrometeorology.princeton.edu/>)
